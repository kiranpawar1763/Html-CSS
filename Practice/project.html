<pre> <h3>  <big> Shivaji Maharaj, born on <sapan style="color: red;">February 19, 1630</sapan>, at Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra.
</big>
    was a legendary warrior and the <span style="color: red;">founder of the Maratha Empire</span>.

    he is revered as one of the greatest rulers in Indian history.
    His life and achievements remain a beacon of inspiration for millions.
    
    <bold><mark>Early Life and Values</mark></bold>
    Shivaji Maharaj was the son of Shahaji Bhosale, a Maratha nobleman, and Jijabai,
    a devout and intelligent woman who played a pivotal role in shaping his character.
    Jijabai instilled in him the values of justice, courage, and devotion to his people. 
    Shivaji grew up under the guidance of his mother and mentor Dadoji Konddeo, acquiring 
    skills in administration, warfare, and statecraft.
    
    <mark>Foundation of the Maratha Empire</mark>
    Shivaji Maharaj displayed remarkable leadership from a young age.
    At the age of 16, he captured the Torna Fort, marking the beginning of his empire.
    His strategies were revolutionary for their time, focusing on guerrilla warfare and
    the effective use of the rugged terrain of the Sahyadri mountains. 
    Through his military genius, he captured several forts and expanded his territory, 
    laying the foundation of the Maratha Empire.
    
   <mark> Administrative Reforms</mark>
    Shivaji Maharaj was not just a warrior but also an exceptional administrator.
    He established a well-structured governance system with a focus on justice and welfare.
    His administration was based on the principle of Swarajya (self-rule), ensuring that the 
    common people had a voice. 
    He implemented policies to promote agriculture, trade, and efficient tax collection, 
    fostering economic prosperity.
    
    <mark>Coronation and Legacy</mark>
    <bold><span style="color: red;">In 1674, Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as the Chhatrapati (Emperor) of the Maratha Kingdom at Raigad Fort.
    This event marked the formal establishment of the Maratha Empire.</span> </bold>
    He envisioned a society free from oppression, where people of all religions could coexist harmoniously.
    Shivaji was also a patron of art, culture, and education, promoting the use of Marathi and Sanskrit.
    
    <mark>Military Genius and Diplomacy</mark>
    Shivaji Maharaj's military strategies were ahead of his time. 
    He built a powerful navy to safeguard India's coastline, making him one of the few 
    Indian rulers to prioritize maritime defense.
    His fortification strategies and swift cavalry movements were instrumental in his success 
    against powerful adversaries, including the Mughal Empire and the Bijapur Sultanate.
     He also used diplomacy skillfully to secure alliances and ensure the stability of his kingdom.
    
   <mark> Conclusion</mark>
    Shivaji Maharaj's life is a testament to courage, vision, and dedication.
    His legacy lives on not only in the forts and institutions he 
    built but also in the hearts of millions who draw inspiration from his ideals of Swarajya and justice.
    Shivaji Maharaj remains a shining example of leadership.
    reminding us of the power of determination and the importance of serving one's
    people with integrity and compassion.
