    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep balance, you must keep moving."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say:</p>

    <p>"To keep your balance, you must keep moving."</p>

    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einstein.</cite></p>

    <p>In literaly studeies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example,
        if you're referencing a famous work like <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite><br> by
        Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.
    </p>

    <p>Another classic example can be seen in
        <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite><br>
        by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a
        timeless story.
